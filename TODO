- Write more tests
- Make an Ipython notebook tutorial
- Maybe change storage of inc as radians instead of degrees?
- Maybe separate integration functionality out of class structure?
- If tstop is reset, reset integrator
- Provide more sensible output from Triple_vector
- Add radii to Triple_vector
- Make sure integration routines handle no CPU limit (-1) correctly
- If run from command line, print triple properties to stderr
