- Separate out command line functionality
- Remove long init declaration
- Add params file support
- Store results rather than write (write to tmp if tool large)
- Make __repr__ method
- IntegrationTimeout exception class
- Restructure directory with source directory
- Update tests
- Make an Ipython notebook tutorial
- Maybe change storage of inc as radians instead of degrees?
- Maybe separate integration functionality out of class structure?
- If tstop is reset, reset integrator
- Provide more sensible output from Triple_vector
- Add radii to Triple_vector
- Make sure integration routines handle no CPU limit (-1) correctly
- If run from command line, print triple properties to stderr
- Add hexadecapole term to Triple_vector 
- Add mass term to vectorial
- Add xintegrate or long_integrate function for long integrations -- i.e.,
  do not store the entire output, but only write to file.
- Make delaunay and vectorial modules.
