- Separate out command line functionality
- Remove long init declaration
- Add params file support
- Store results rather than write (write to tmp if too large)
- IntegrationTimeout exception class
- Update tests
- Make an Ipython notebook tutorial
- Maybe separate integration functionality out of class structure?
- If tstop is reset, reset integrator
- Provide more sensible output from Triple_vector
- Add radii to Triple_vector
- Make sure integration routines handle no CPU limit (-1) correctly
- If run from command line, print triple properties to stderr
- Add hexadecapole term to Triple_vector 
- Add mass term to vectorial
- Add xintegrate or long_integrate function for long integrations -- i.e.,
  do not store the entire output, but only write to file.
- Make delaunay and vectorial modules.
- Allow TripleDelaunay to be set by epsoct
- Allow tstop to be set in Kozai timescales as well as yr
- Add support for tides

Profiling (possible bottlenecks):
  - Frequent clock checks
  - Dynamically calculating cosphi, etc.

Tutorial:
  - Create a triple
  - Integrate the triple
  - Plot the eccentricity, g1, inc, etc.
  - Show the maximum eccentricity as a function of inclination, TPQ
  - Show the inclination at which maximum eccentricity is reached as a
    function of m2
  - Period calculation
  - Period as a function of inclination
  - Some famous plots from the literature:
    - Figs. 3, 4, 5 of Ford et al. (2000)
    - Figs. 1, 2, & 3 from Blaes et al. (2002)
    - Fig. 1 Naoz et al. (2011)
    - Fig. 2 of Katz et al. (2011)
    - Fig. 11 of Naoz et al. (2013)
