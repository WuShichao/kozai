secular.py is a code to compute the evolution of a hierarchical triple
system.  It includes the quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapole terms of
the Hamiltonian expansion, and each can be toggled.

Additionally, terms to include relativistic corrections (both precession
and radiation) can be included.  Finally, a prescription exists to model
rapid eccentricity oscillations (see Antognini et al. 2014).  This feature
is very approximate and is unstable, however.
