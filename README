triplesec.py is a code to compute the evolution of a hierarchical triple
system.  It includes the quadrupole, octupole, and hexadecapole terms of the
Hamiltonian expansion, and each can be toggled.  Additionally, terms to
include relativistic corrections (both precession and radiation) can be
included.  

The integrator used is the GSL ODE integrator.
